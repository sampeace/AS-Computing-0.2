# AQA CS AS Notes

## 3.5 Fundamentals of data representation

### 3.5.1 Number systems
+ natural numbers

**definition**: those are numbers used for counting.

**examples**: 0,1,2,3,4
``` 
this is an area for code or examples etc

Counting uses natural number
A set of natural number can expressed as:
N={0,1,2,3...}

```

+ integer numbers
+ rational numbers
+ irrational numbers
+ real numbers
+ ordinal numbers

### 3.5.2 Number bases
+ base 2: those are binary numbers. example: 1010<sub>2</sub>. See [this site](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-5.html) for more infomation
+ base 10
+ base 16
+ conversion between denary, binary and hex

### 3.5.3 Units of information
+ bit and bytes
+ units of kilo, kilbi etc

### 3.5.4 Binary number system

#### Unsigned binary & Signed binary

+ Unsigned binary numbers don't have a bit to show if a number is positive or negative. If you have an 8-bit unsigned binary number the highest value can be 255, there are 256 (2 to the power of 8)

+ Signed binary numbers use one bit at the begining to indicate weather it is a positive or negative number. An example for this is an 8-bit numbers the maximum is 127 as there are 128 (2 to the power of 7) and the lowest is -128. 

 	8-bit positive 01011010
	8-bit negative 11010011

#### unsigned binary arithmetics

+ Adding tow numbers together is very basic and is easy accomplished, when doing this you need to remember that. 

	0 + 0 = 0
	0 + 1 = 1
	1 + 1 = 10 (This is because the other one is carried forward into the second digit creating a 10)
	1 + 1 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11

+ Applying it to some examples, 

	##### 1010 + 0010 = 1100 (This is because the second 1 is carried over)

	##### 1010 + 1111 = 11000
	
#### signed binary with two's complement
#### fixed point form binary representation of numbers with fractional parts

### 3.5.5 Information encoding system

#### Character form of a decimal digit
#### ASCII and Unicode
#### Error checking and correction

### 3.5.6 Representing images, sound and other data

#### Bit patterns, images,  sound  and other  data
#### Analogue and digital
#### Analogue and digital conversion
#### Bitmapped graphics
#### Digital representation of sound
#### Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
#### Data compression
#### Encryption
